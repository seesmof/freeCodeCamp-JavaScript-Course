              Synchronous programming is code execution line by line. The
              process we have with our example is we create sort of a branch of
              our code when the pizza declaration is executed.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>SetTimeout</em> is an asynchronous function. In synchronous
              programming we need to wait for the result or the ending of the
              execution of other functions before continuing to the next task.
            </p>
            <p>
              In our code we don't want a function to complete multiple things.
              So asynchronous programming is making our functions do their stuff
              on sort of a separate branch or a timeline, so to say.
            </p>
            <p>
              We created an asynchronous function where we wait for 1 second to
              create our pizza and then make a callback to notify our customer,
              but do we actually need to pass our callback as an argument? Not
              sure yet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, one more interesting thing is that if we remove the
              <em>let</em> declaration of our pizza variable, we simply skip the
              last line where we eat the pizza which is weird and I dont get it.
