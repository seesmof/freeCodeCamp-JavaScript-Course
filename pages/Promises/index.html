            <p>
              So, promises in JS are objects that promise to return some data in
              the future, when they get it. But for now, when they dont have it,
              they just promise you that it will be there, but nobody knows at
              what time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Promises are used in asynchronous programming to return a value in
              the future. We can declare them by
              <kbd>new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {})</kbd>.
              <em>new</em> means that we create a new object,
              <em>Promise</em> is a constructor for this object, which takes a
              function as a parameter. This is where our async function goes.
              And the async function should also take two function:
              <em>resolve</em> and <em>reject</em>. <em>resolve</em> is called
              when the promise is resolved, or the data is successfully
              retrieved, and <em>reject</em> is called when the promise is
              rejected, or something went wrong while getting the data.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the example below we use a promise to get the data from an
              async function. The function is just a <kbd>setTimeout</kbd>,
              nothing serious there yet, and it resolves with some object, or,
              rejects with an error. If it resolves, we can see a text in green,
              if not, we can see an error a bit below in red.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Example:</strong>
            </p>
            <div
              class="font-medium text-green-600"
              id="gotDataSuccessfully"
            ></div>
            <div class="font-medium text-red-600" id="didntGetData"></div>

            <p>
              Also, a little useful thing to know about the <kbd>.then</kbd> and
              <kbd>.catch</kbd> blocks is in then, it takes two parameters, for
              example onSuccess and onFail, and first one is executed when we
              resolve the promise and the second one when we reject it. And so
              if we put both parameters in the then, it will sort of compare the
              result and if there is a rejection, but also a success, it will be
              executed, as well as the other nested thens. Well, thats as far as
              I understood. But, if we have a catch nested in our promise call,
              if there's an error or a rejection at any point, it just skipps
              everything and jumps straight into that catch and handles the
              error there. Which makes sense.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the guy in the video says that setting both parameters
              for the <kbd>.then</kbd> block is quite uncommon, so we should
              rather just write down our global catch block at the end. This way
              we dont cause any problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, one more method we have for our promise object is
              <kbd>.finally</kbd> which executes no matter what other nested
              blocks got executed. Not sure when its useful, but the guy in the
              video says that we might use it for cleaning up any stuff that
              might be left running. So, even if theres an error in our
              execution, the finally block will be executed anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now we wanna go ahead and try using a fetch API to get some actual
              weather data and output it below
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Example using Fetch API:</strong>
            </p>
            <div
              class="font-medium text-green-600"
              id="gotWeatherSuccess"
            ></div>
            <div class="font-medium text-red-600" id="didntGetWeather"></div>

            <p>
              So, thats it with promises. A promise is an object that is yet to
              return a value, but will do as soon as it gets it. Promises are
              useful when fetching data, getting input from a user, loading
              files, etc. Promises also make chaining asynchronous functions way
              easier and more readable. We use nested <kbd>.then</kbd> blocks, a
              <kbd>.catch</kbd> block for any errors and, optionally, a
              <kbd>.finally</kbd> block for cleanup.
